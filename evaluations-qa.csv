RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a clear example of using Scikit-learn to calculate various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC, which directly addresses the question. The code is relevant and demonstrates practical usage of the library for evaluation metrics."
RELEVANT,The generated answer provides a specific endpoint and a curl command that directly addresses the question about posting an event when testing locally. It is relevant and useful information for someone looking to implement the functionality described in the question.
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the 'manifest unknown' message by explaining what it means and providing a solution for the issue. It correctly identifies that the message indicates the specified image tag could not be found and suggests using the correct tag to resolve the problem, making it highly relevant to the user's query."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides clear and specific steps to configure TensorFlow for GPU on an Ubuntu system, including necessary installations such as Nvidia drivers, CUDA, and cuDNN. It directly addresses the question and guides the user through the installation process, making it highly relevant."
